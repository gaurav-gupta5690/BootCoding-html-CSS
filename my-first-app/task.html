 <p id="abc"> Sub: Application for Nurse Practitioner <br>

    Respected HR manager, <br>
    
    I am (name) and I am writing this letter to you for the internship opportunity for which your hospital/Institute gave an ad in the newspaper (advertisement source). Sir, I am a fresh graduate in the nursing course (degree name) and I am looking for a job. I am applying for this job because I think that your hospital/Institute is the perfect place for me to start with. Your hospital/institute has a very reputable name and I will be very lucky to get this opportunity. I am a very hardworking and nurturing personality and I tend to know the psychology of the patients I deal with. <br>
    
    I hope that you will find me very good in all departments related to my work. <br>
    
    I hope a positive response. <br>
    
    Best Regards,
    
        </p>
